        <h3>Cloud Operations</h3>
        <p>I  have been working in the Cloud Industry since last March'19 and it has been a heck of a ride. I have learnt a lot ranging from a plethora of DevOps tools and managing some high-profile customers.</p>

        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>I have always been fascinated by the Internet since I got my "Internet-senses". Since then I kept on googling articles on DNS Server, Client, UTF-8 encoding style and other key concepts. Currently I am enjoying the course of Web Development and educating myself. Angela, you're the best!</p>

        <h3>Management</h3>
        <p>To be honest, I did not think that I would excel in this particular skill. I did take part in chartiy events in my school days as well as took part in organizational committees such as IEEE and ISTE. However, my management skill has been on an other level after joining the corporate world.</p>
